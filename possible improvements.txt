This is just a test project, there are many places that could be improved as some examples:

- better UX
	- make a custom video player, so you can hide the original video player (as fabric example does)

- database could "INSERT INTO" async/thread

- make some tests

- make a docker image of postgres (or just use a cloud solution instead)

- image compression before sending to backend

- sanatize and cryptography inputs send to backend

- saniteze input received on backend

- the application is very heavy on both side (most on server) (maybe not accomplishable)
